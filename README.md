## üìö Project Description

This is a simple To-Do List with CRUD operations, made with ReactJS.

## üìå What did I learn?

In this project, I had the opportunity to practice working with ReactJS, using concepts like states, lists, immutability, properties, components and keys.

Also, I was able to work with TypeScript, allowing a better organization project's files and preventing bugs.

The most challenging aspect of the project was manipulating the array of items in the list to enable the editing functionality for specific items. I successfully implemented this feature by utilizing the map method to filter the item that needed editing, defining its new content, and updating the array accordingly.
